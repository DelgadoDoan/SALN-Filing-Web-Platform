## Description
The SALN (Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth) is a transparency document required of public officials, but the process of filling it up manually may be error-prone and tedious. This project introduces a web-based SALN filing platform to streamline the process, offering digital form entry, JSON import/export, PDF generation/export, and a passwordless authentication method via a magic link. This ensures that all information supplied by the user is both correct and consistent. The app only aids in digital SALN form generation and does not handle official submission of the document. 

The app is mainly built using the Laravel 12 web framework, with PHP version 8.4.

## Features

### Authentication 
- **Magic Link Login:** The users can create and access accounts using third-party providers such as Google, GitHub, and Apple with no passwords involved

### SALN Form Creation 
- The users can start a SALN form wherein it covers all required sections such as personal information, family details, assets, liabilities, business interests, and relatives in government

### Storage
- All SALN forms and related user data are securely stored in a **SQLite database**

### PDF Generation
- The users can preview and generate a printable A4 PDF version of their SALN form. The generated PDF will follow the official layout of the government-issued form.

### Import and Export JSON
- SALN Forms can be exported and imported as JSON files for local backup or transfer between devices
